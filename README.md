# metaflow-experimentation
A repository about my experimentation with the metaflow framework.

## Description
 In this repository, there will be the code that I built to run some experimentations with the [metaflow framework](https://docs.metaflow.org/).

 The repository is structured like :
 * the **decorator_experimentation** folder : code associated to the decorator test on metaflow
 * the **hearthstone_deckarchetypeestimator** folder : code associated to the decorator test on metaflow
 * the **data** folder : folder that is containing data for the different experimentations
