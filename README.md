# metaflow-experimentation
A repository about my experimentation with the metaflow framework

## Description
 In this repository, there will be the code that I built to run some experimentations with the [metaflow framework](https://docs.metaflow.org/).

 The repository is structured like :
 * the decorator folder : code associated to the decorator test on metaflow
 * the hearthstone-archetype-estimator folder : code associated to the decorator test on metaflow
 * the data folder : folder that is containing data for the different experimentations
